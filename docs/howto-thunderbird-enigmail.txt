How to get Thunderbird User Agent with Enigmail to fetch unknown keys from
this Server

* make the server listen on TCP 11371
* in Thunderbird: Enigmail->Preferences->Keyserver
* add the name of the server like keys.example.org
* when sending an email that should be encrypted now you can
  click "Download missing keys", may take a few seconds, works for me :)
